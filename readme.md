# Symfony Security Oauth

## Info


## Credits

Our work is based on https://github.com/willdurand/BazingaOAuthServerBundle, created by @willdurand. 
As we were looking for a generic, reusable library, the bundle was not a solution for us. But it contains a lot of 
functionality we needed for oauth authentication.
